# Sentimental-analysis-stocks
Using nltk to perform sentimental analysis on stocks headlines

It is to use with buy analysis(eg my previous code on buy signals) and further analyze the buy stocks using nltk

You can change the number of days the average sentiment for the stock is based on and this can further filter and weigh the buy list of the stocks
